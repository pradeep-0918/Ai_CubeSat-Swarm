# 🚀 AI-Powered CubeSat Swarm for Space Debris Removal

## 🔎 Problem Statement  
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is congested with **millions of debris fragments**, especially in the **1–10 cm range**.  
Even small debris pieces travel at ~7–8 km/s, making them dangerous enough to damage satellites, ISS, or future space missions.  

Current methods focus on large debris, but **no scalable solution exists for micro- to small-sized debris (1–10 cm)**.

## 🎯 Objective  
Develop an **autonomous swarm of AI-powered CubeSats** capable of:  
1. **Detecting** 1–10 cm space debris in real time.  
2. **Tracking** their trajectories with AI and onboard sensors.  
3. **Coordinating** swarm movements for efficient orbital coverage.  
4. **Capturing or deorbiting** debris safely using innovative mechanisms.
